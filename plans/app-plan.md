üß© Concept Overview

App Name (placeholder): IssueMind

Purpose: Help developers triage, prioritize, and solve GitHub issues faster with AI-generated suggestions.

Frontend stack: Next.js + ShadCN/UI + mock API layer

Design vibe: Developer / dark mode friendly / clear hierarchy

üß± Core UX Flow

Think of it as an app where a user:

1. Logs in with GitHub or a demo account

2. Selects a repository

3. Views issues (list + AI insights)

4. Opens an issue to see suggestions, possible fixes, code diffs, and related issues

5. Optionally runs AI actions: explain, summarize, draft PR, etc.

6. Reviews AI outputs via modals or drawers
