### Technical Implementation

**Framework & Tools**:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- shadcn/ui components (Radix UI)
- React 19 with hooks
- next-themes for dark mode
- sonner for toast notifications
- cmdk for command palette
- lucide-react for icons

**Key Patterns**:
- Server Components for static content
- Client Components for interactivity
- Proper use of 'use client' directive
- Route groups for layout organization
- Dynamic routes with params
- Mock async operations with delays
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Modal dialogs for detailed content

## 🎯 User Flows

### Primary Flow
1. User visits `/` → redirects to `/login`
2. User clicks "Continue with GitHub" → animates → redirects to `/dashboard`
3. Dashboard shows repos and stats
4. User clicks repo → views filtered issues list
5. User clicks issue → sees full details with AI panel
6. User clicks "Generate Fix" → AI creates code diff → modal displays result
7. Result tracked in `/ai-tasks`

### Command Palette Flow
1. User presses ⌘K anywhere
2. Command palette opens
3. User types to search repos/issues/pages
4. User selects item → navigates instantly

### Settings Flow
1. User opens user dropdown → clicks Settings
2. Changes theme to light mode
3. Toggles experimental features
4. Clicks Save → success toast

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px (sidebar hidden, single column)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (sidebar visible, flexible layout)
- Desktop: > 1024px (full layout with sidebars)

## 🎨 Design System

**Colors**:
- Primary: Default theme color
- Destructive: Red (errors, urgent)
- Muted: Gray (secondary text)
- Accent: Hover states
- Background: Dark (#0a0a0a) / Light (#ffffff)

**Typography**:
- Font: Geist Sans (UI), Geist Mono (code)
- Sizes: sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl

**Spacing**:
- Consistent padding/margins using Tailwind scale
- Card padding: p-4, p-6
- Section gaps: space-y-4, space-y-6

## 🚀 Performance

- Static generation where possible
- Client-side state management for interactivity
- Lazy loading of modals
- Optimized re-renders with proper component structure
- Fast page transitions

## 📝 Notes

- All authentication is mocked (no real auth)
- All AI responses are pre-generated (no API calls)
- All data is in-memory (no database)
- GitHub integration is simulated (no OAuth)
- This is a **demonstration app** showcasing UI/UX patterns
