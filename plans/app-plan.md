## 🧮 Interaction Flow Summary

Login → Dashboard → Select Repository → View Issues → Open Issue → Trigger AI Action  
                       ↓  
                   AI Tasks Overview

- **Login Flow:** Simulated authentication → routed to the main dashboard.
- **Repository Flow:** Repository selection updates the active workspace context.
- **Issues Flow:** User navigates between the global issues list and individual issue view.
- **AI Actions Flow:** When an AI action (Summarize, Generate Fix, Explain) runs, it logs a mock task under `/ai-tasks`.
- **Task Review Flow:** The result of each AI task can open modals, drawers, or appear as linked summaries in context.
- **Settings Flow:** User can adjust preferences anytime; persistent mock state remembered locally.
